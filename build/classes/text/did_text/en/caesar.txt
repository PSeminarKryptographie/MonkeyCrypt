Ave! I am Julius Caesar, a famous Roman landlord. You've certainly heard of me, after all, I conquered all of Gaul. Well, with the exception of a village that does not stop resisting me, I admit it. But that is also unfair, they have a secret magic potion! But I also have a secret weapon: The Caesar-Encryption named after me. So I send secret messages to my legions.
This works as follows:

A -> E
B -> F
...
Z -> D

Can you guess what the following secret text means?
Secret: Hiv Jimrh peyivx mq Aeph
Plain text: The enemy lurks in ____ [forest]

Excellent! As you can see, the Caesar encryption always replaces one letter with exactly one other. Therefore, this method is referred to as monoalphabetic substitution. You can illustrate the substitution by writing the normal alphabet, and underneath it, a comma, beginning with any letter, and proceeding accordingly. This first letter is then the "key" of the secret.
Here is an example with the key D:



This is a Caesar disc. The plaintext is outside (uppercase), the secrettext is inside. You always see the key below the plain text "A". If you turn on the inner disc, the key changes.

Crafting: So you can tinker yourself a Caesar disc: Prints under [print] the document [Caesar-disk] out. Glue the sheet to a piece of cardboard and then carefully cut the two slices. Lay the two slices on a cork and fasten them with a tear in their center. The Caesar disc is finished!

After the whole tinkering, it will be time to clarify how the cryptographic algorithm of Caesar encryption now works. As a first step, we have to convert our letters into numbers (A = 0, B = 1, etc) using alphabet index coding. Let's see an assignment with the key D (= 5):

Do you notice a regularity? I agree! There will always be a 5 added! Why just 5? Because 5 (= D) exactly corresponds to our key. The only exception are the high numbers, with a rule called modulo. Under MATHEMATICS you can learn more about it. Conversely, you simply have to subtract the key again to decrypt.

Notice:
In the case of the Caesar encryption, which is also referred to as the shift cipher, each plain text character m is replaced by a character c, shifted by k in the alphabet. If all the characters are numbered according to their place in the alphabet with the length n,
Ek (m) = (m + k) mod n = c
