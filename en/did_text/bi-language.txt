Habillobi!
I am Joachim. Joachim Ringelnatz. Well, actually I'm Hans Bötticher. But Ringelnatz sounds more funny, don't you think? Do you know what sounds funny? If you append "bi" behind each vowel of a word. Try it!
Originally the bi-language was part of a special German dialect. In this way, inhabitants of the city wanted to complicate their language of the Buttians. While the Buttjersprache has its own vocabulary and many rules, the bi language, as you have learned, is quite simple and sounds quite incomprehensible, if you speak it quickly!
The bi language is very similar to other game languages, e.g. the B language. A "b" is inserted behind each vowel, and the same vowel is inserted again. Dabas klibingt dabann sobo!
What do I myself have to do with the game language, you ask? Well, I did not invent them, but in my "poem in bi language" made famous. However, I have not quite adhered to the rules, because in poetry everything is allowed. Maybe you can find out where a fault is?
