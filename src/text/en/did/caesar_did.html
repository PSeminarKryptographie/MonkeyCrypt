        I am Julius Caesar, the famous Roman general. You have surely heard
        of me, after all, I have conquered the Gauls - well, apart from one
        village that has not yet given in, I admit it. However, that is
        also unfair, for they have a secret magic potion! But</span><span

        I
        have a secret weapon: the encryption named after me,
        Caesar cipher. So I send

      Excellent! As you can see, in the Caesar cipher, one letter
      replaces another. That is why this is a monoalphabetic cipher.
      You can replace it by writing down the normal alphabet,
      and underneath a secret alphabet, starting on any letter.</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span

      The first
      letter is the "key" for the secret text.<br>
      Here is an example with the key D: [][]<br>

      This is a Caesar cipher wheel. The plain text alphabet is
      on the outside (uppercase), the secret alphabet on the inside.
      The key is always below the plain text "A".
      If you press the arrow[e], it changes the key.<br>
      [insert encryption exercise with any key]<br>
      Pro tip: You can even make a cipher wheel yourself: Print
      under [print] of the document [Caesar-scheibe]. Glue the
      paper on a piece of cardboard and cut the two slices
      carefully. Place the  two slices on a cork and fasten them
      with a hole in the center. The Caesar cipher wheel is finished!
