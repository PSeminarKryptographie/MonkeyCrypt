Multiplier cipher


The key of Caesar encryption is a sign of the alphabet.

The key should be coprime to the length of the alphabet.
A random coprimer key can be generated.
All keys are coprime to an alphabet that has a prime number as its length.

Characters that are not contained in the alphabet are not encrypted.

The multiplicative cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution.
